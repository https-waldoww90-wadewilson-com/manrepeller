Man Repeller is a collection of tools to repel men.

Title/idea from the fabulous fashion blog, The Man Repeller (http://www.manrepeller.com/) started by the inordinately stylish Leandra Medine. As she so aptly stated:
"Good fashion is about pleasing women, not men, so as it happens, the trends that we love, men hate. And that is fantastic."

First tool in here: Man Repeller colors for your ITerm. Why do pink and green repel men? As it turns out, men are statistically more likely to be color blind than women. So if someone _ahem_ is peering over your shoulder telling you that you're doing something the "wrong way...well not really the wrong way" and "that's not how they would do it" maybe you need to repel those men, er, those someones with bright colors and text that is completely unreadable because it's green on pink.
